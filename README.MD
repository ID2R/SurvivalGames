## About This Project

For years ago, a lot of players want a SurvivalGames system like HiveMC's one and since HiveMC closed at April 15, 2021, there is not another place to play their games. So I decided to recreate their game-modes for free and let other developers modify it as they want, that's why it's open source.

## Features

Here's why:
* MySQL and SQLite storage system
* Redis support for bungee mode
* Single and Multiple map system (Multiple means you can `/vote` for map like HiveMC)
* SlimeWorldManager support for better map loading and restore system
* Very lightweight, so it won't affect your server performance a lot
